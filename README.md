# zig adventures

Everytime I have a question about how to do something in zig I stream on [my
Twitch](https://twitch.tv/slugbyte) and figure it out. 

## Adventures 
* `src/comptime-enum.zig` - how to create an enum using `@Type()`
* `src/comptime-union.zig` - how to create an union using `@Type()`
